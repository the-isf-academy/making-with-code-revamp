## [0] Planning Document

This is a big project with a lot of room for customization. It is important for each group to plan out their game prior to coding.

{{< write-action "Plan your game with your group." >}} Once you have completed your planning document, meet with a teacher to talk through your project.

##  [2] Set Up

For this project, each group will share one git repository. It is your responsibility to regularly commit to your repository.

{{< code-action "Download your repository with starter code for your project." >}}

```shell
cd Desktop
cd cs9/unit_02
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project-game-group#.git
```
> replace `#` with your group number 

{{< expand "cs9.1 Groups" >}}

### [Advanced Git]

When using Git as an individual, the primary action is to `push` your work to the server. However, **when multiple people are working on a single project you must remember to `pull` before beginning to code**. 

Communication is key when collaborating on a repository. **We highly recommend communicating with your teammates about who is going to work on which file.** If multiple people edit the same lines of code in the same file, you will have to work together to resolve the merge conflicts. 


Let's practice pushing and pulling by updating the `README.md` file. 

{{< code-action >}} **Choose one person to open the `README.md` file.** 

{{< write-action >}} **Add their name to the file.**

{{< code-action "Save and close the file. Then push the updates to Github" >}}

{{< code-action >}} **Once the changes have been made, the teammate should `git pull` the changes.**

> ```shell
> git pull 
> ```

{{< code-action >}} **The teammate should now open the `README.md` file.** They should see the changes to the file. 

{{< write-action >}} **Add their name to the file.**

## [3] General Tips and Tricks

### [Making a Map]

Make sure all of the assets for the map are in the folder of the repository. This includes:

- `.png` tilesets you download from the internet 
- `.tsx` files you create from tilesets in Tiled
- `.tmx` map files you create 

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit02/project1.png" width="70%" >}}

{{< code-action >}} **Download the map editor, [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled)**
> Be sure to select 'No thanks, just take me to the downloads' 

You can find assets to make your map here:

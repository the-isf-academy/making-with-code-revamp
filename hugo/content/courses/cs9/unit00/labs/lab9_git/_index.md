# Version Control Lab


In this mini-lab, we're going to learn two new tools, git and Github, to help us with version control.

## [0] Github Set up

You have already used git a few times. Remember typing `git clone
...`? Cloning means pulling a copy of a repository down from github onto your
own computer. Now we are going to take the next step, editing a repository and pushing it to the cloud. 


---

### [Terminal]

{{< code-action "Double-check that git is installed." >}} If you do not see a version number, it should automatically install `git`.
```shell
git --version
```

{{< code-action "Configure git">}} : Type each of these commands into Terminal. 

> Make sure to replace the information inside the `< >` with your information.

- `git config --global user.name <Your name>`
- `git config --global user.email <Your school email>`


{{< code-action "Install a credential manager to store your Github credentials securely." >}} *Copy and paste the lines below one at a time. It may ask you for your computer password.*
```shell
brew tap microsoft/git
brew install --cask git-credential-manager-core
```

{{< expand "Github Auth Token" >}}

Github uses personal access tokens to ensure security when remotely accessing a repository. You will need your token when using git from the Terminal. 

{{< code-action "Go to your github settings:">}}  [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

> 0. **Select** `Generate new token`.
> 0. **Type** `CS9` in the `Note` box.
> 0. **Set** the `Expiration` to `90 days`.
> 0. **Check** the `repo` box.
> 0. **Select** `Generate token` at the bottom of the page. 

{{< code-action "Copy your token to your Notes application.">}} 

{{< /expand >}}

## [1] Your First Repo

**From now on, all code for this class will be stored as individual git repositories.** We are going to start now, by setting up getting your repository for the next lab. 

### [Cloning Your Module Repository]

We have set up repositories for each student to populate with their do now files.

{{< code-action "Go to your" >}} `cs9/unit00_drawing` **folder.**

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit00_drawing/
```

{{< code-action "Clone your repo. This will copy it onto your computer." >}}  

> Below you'll see that the `git clone` command has a `yourGithubUsername`. 
>
> **You need to replace this with your username**
>
> *e.g. `https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_modules_emmaqbrown`*


```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_modules_yourGithubUsername
```

If successful, should see something like this in your Terminal:
```shell
Cloning into 'lab_modules_emmaqbrown'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 33, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (33/33), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (22/22), done.
remote: Total 33 (delta 13), reused 22 (delta 8), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (33/33), 7.51 KiB | 7.51 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (13/13), done.
```

## [2] Working with Git

Whenever you are working on a project, you will go through four steps:

- **Edit files**: Work on all the files in this project just like normal.
- **Review changes**: Look at your changes and make sure you are happy with
  them.
- **Commit**: Save your changes to the repository.
- **Push**: Push your copy of the repository up to github.

Let's practice.

---

### [Step 0: Edit the README]

Today we are going to practice commiting files to Github. Let's start by editing the `README.md` file. 

{{< code-action "Open the" >}}  `README.md` **file using Atom:**

```shell
atom README.md
```

As you've seen before, `README` files are like a guide to what's contained inside
a repository and how to use it. 

Right now the `README` is pretty bare. 

{{< code-action "Add your name as the Author." >}} Be sure to save.

Your final markdown file should look something like this:
```md
# Modules Lab
### Author: Ms. Brown
```


{{< aside "Markdown" >}}
The `README.md` file is written in a simple language called Markdown that
allows you to format text. 

[Here's a quick guide to
markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet). 

When you have a `.md` file
open in Atom, you can preview the rendered version with the following menu
option: `Packages > Markdown Preview > Toggle Preview`.
{{< /aside >}}

--- 

### [Step 1: Review changes]

Once you have made some changes to `README.md`, save your work in Atom and go
back to the Terminal. 

{{< code-action "Let's use git to see what changes you have made." >}}

```shell
git status
```

You will see the following message:

```shell
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

ðŸ‘€ **Read the whole message.** It is telling you that only file that you have changed is `README.md`. 


{{< expand "To see specific changes" >}}

{{< code-action "Use another command to get details about what changes were made:" >}}
```shell
git diff
```

Now you will see a description of what you have added and what you have removed
from `README.md`:

```shell
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 2c637ca..00ca290 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1,9 +1,4 @@
 # Do Nows
-### Author: YOUR NAME GOES HERE
+### Author: Ms. Brown
 
-
-> INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
-> - A description of this repository
-> - A link to the `do now` page of the website.
->
-> *You may delete this section when complete.*
\ No newline at end of file
+This repository holds the do now exercises. The exercises can be found (here)[http://localhost:1313/courses/cs9/unit00/do_now/].
```

> To get out of `git diff`, type `q` then `return`.



**You should always run at a minimum run `git status` before you add changes to your repository.** To make sure you're adding the changes you meant to add, run  `git diff`. 

If you noticed any typos, or want to add something, edit `README.md` in Atom again, and then run `git status` and `git diff` again.

{{< /expand >}}

### [Step 2: Commit]

Now it's time to add these changes to your repository. 

**A *commit* is a collection of one or more changes that belong together.** 

For example, if you wanted to add a photo to your README document, you would need to 

0. edit `README.md`, telling it to include the photo
0. add the image file itself to the repo. 

These two changes belong together, so they should be part of the same commit.

**You will prepare a commit by adding all the files that have changes.**

{{< code-action "Let's add your" >}} `README.md` **to a new commit:**

```shell
git add README.md
```

{{< code-action "Run" >}} `git status` **again.** You will see that `README.md` has gone from red to green because it has been added to a new commit.

```shell
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   README.md
```

Now we are ready to finalize the commit. 

{{< code-action "Describe what you did, using a commit message." >}}
```shell
git commit -m "added name to readme"
```
> Every time you commit code, you need to write a message explaining what you have done. 
>
> Anybody reading your code (teachers, peers, a future version of you) will read the  log of your changes to understand what has been happening on the project. 


---

### [Step 3: Push]

Now it's time to sync the copy of your repo with the copy on github.

{{< code-action "Push your code:" >}}  
```shell
git push
```
> **A dialog box should pop up, select "Sign in with your browser, then follow the instructions"**
>
> If you do not see this, notify a teacher.


If all is successful with the login, you should see something below in Terminal. 
```shell
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 302 bytes | 302.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
To https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_modules/emmaqbrown
   67838f1..4742ecf  main -> main
```

{{< code-action "Go to your repository page on Github.com." >}} You should see your updated version of your `README.md` at the bottom of the page.
> https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_modules_yourGithubUsername
> 
> *Be sure to change, 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME' to your actual username.*

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have successfully made your fist push to Github! ðŸŽ‰**

This probably felt like a lot of work just to save your work. That's true. But
it will get easier as you get used to it, and you will start to see the value of
using git when you start working on bigger projects. 

*If you're not glad you
learned git five years from now, come see us and we'll give you some extra
credit or something :)*

## [1] Ball Animations


### [Breathing]

{{< code-action "Open the file:" >}} `breathing_animation.py`

{{< code-action "Try running the file:" >}} `python breathing_animation.py`. Currently, there is no animation. A purple ball just appears on the screen. 

{{< code-action "Change the code so the ball grows and shrinks." >}} It should look like it's "breathing".

### [Movement]

{{< code-action "Open the file:" >}} `movement_animation.py`

{{< code-action "Try running the file:" >}} `python movement_animation.py`. Currently, there is no animation. A light blue ball just appears on the screen. 

{{< code-action "Change the code so the ball moves around the screen." >}} It up to you to decide how it moves. It could:
- move up or down
- move up and down
- move diagonally
- move randomly

### [Color]

{{< code-action "Open the file:" >}} `color_animation.py`

{{< code-action "Try running the file:" >}} `python color_animation.py`. Currently, there is no animation. A green ball just appears against a yellow background on the screen.

{{< code-action "Change the code so the ball changes in color." >}} It up to you to decide how the color changes.
> Note, the color is decided with RGB values as opposed to names of colors. 
> 
> - `line 39`: changes the color mode to accept RGB values

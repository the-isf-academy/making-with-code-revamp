# Labs

In this unit, labs will focus on introducing key Computer Science concepts and practices. Students will use the [Turtle library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to aid in their learning of Python computation thinking strategies. Students are expected to complete each lab by pushing their code to Github and completing the Google form check-in.

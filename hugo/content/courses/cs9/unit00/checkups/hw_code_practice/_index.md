# Code Practice Homework

{{< expand "Part 0: Who are you? (5 minutes)" >}}
Send your teaching team an email answering the following questions:

1. What is your name and what would you like us to call you?
2. What is one goal you have for this class?
3. What is one thing that makes you nervous about this class?
4. What is your favorite dessert?

*Note: The time listed for each part of the homework is an estimate of how long we think you should spend on each part of the homework. Don't worry if something takes you a little more or less time, but if you are spending significantly more time on some part of the homework, please reach out to {{< teacher >}} so we can figure out why :)*

{{< expand "Part 1: Your first program (15 minutes)" >}}
Use Python's `turtle` library to draw something. You can do this with the [functions we talked about in class](../../lessons/lesson00) or more from the [Turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html) if you want a challenge.

### Setup
To get started, open a new Terminal window, navigate to the directory where your homework is saved, and tell Terminal to open Atom and work on a new file:

```shell
~$ cd Desktop/cs9/unit_00/
~/Desktop/cs9/unit_00$ atom homework_01.py
```

Atom should have opened a new, unsaved, empty file. Paste the [starter code below](#starter-code) into the window and save it. You can see this file in Terminal:

```shell
~/Desktop/cs9/unit_00$ ls
homework_01.py
```

Now run the program.

```shell
~/Desktop/cs9/unit_00$ python homework_01.py
```

A new window will open and draw a square. Press enter in
the Terminal window to close the drawing window.

### Your turn

- Change the code so it draws something new. (It might help to sketch what you are trying to draw.)
- After you make a change, save the file and run the program to make sure it worked properly.
- Be ready to share your drawing in class next time we meet. **You don't need to submit anything for this part of the assignment before class.**


### Starter code

```python
# Unit 0 Lesson 1
# Author: Your Name

from turtle import *

# You can add comments anywhere you want. The code below draws a square.
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)

# This makes the program wait until you type some input.
# Otherwise, it would quit right after it finished drawing.
input("Press enter...")
```

# Deliverables

- An email, as described above.
- A python file called `homework_01.py`, ready to share in class.
- The program should draw something.

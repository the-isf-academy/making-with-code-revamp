# Make a Self Map

{{< devnote >}}
- Replace Google Slides (Jacob's self map) with screenshot? <br>
- Combine Self Map, Initial Sketch, Planning, Progress update into a project page?
{{< /devnote >}}

The final project for the drawing unit will include personal reflection and self-expression. Before jumping into the final project deliverables, we'll start with a small brainstorm. In this homework assignment, you will create a Self Map.

We'd like your Self Map to have at least these four stems:

- I want...
- I am...
- I like...
- I believe...

For each of the four stems, you'll then attach multiple answers that are true to you. Include photos, links, videos, your own sketches, symbols, etc; there is no need to add any textual explanations. Here is a template on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c6vglYti5aXiBkhx6ye5Nwm4Fl64MdOtSaROqElC2UU/edit?usp=sharing). To use this template, go to FILE --> Make a Copy.

## Notes

Please feel free to personalize the Google Slide template as much as you'd like, as long as it incorporates the 4 stems. You also don't need to use Google Slides if you don't want to. You might check out [draw.io](https://draw.io), [Prezi](https://prezi.com), or another online platform. We do suggest that you complete your self-map digitally, but you can also try making a paper-based map if you'd like.

We will be sharing these Self Maps in the next class.

## Deliverables

- A link to a completed Self Map (which includes responses to the 4 stems).

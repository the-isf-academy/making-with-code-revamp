# Draw an Initial Sketch for Final Project

{{< devnote >}}
- Replace Identity Art / CS Art Google Slides <br>
- Combine Self Map, Initial Sketch, Planning, Progress update into a project page?
{{< /devnote >}}

Using the brainstorm from your self-map (HW 0.6), start thinking about what you would like to draw in the final project. Remember that there is an option to transfer your drawing onto something physical--maybe you want to make stickers using the vinyl cutter or etch it onto something using the laser cutter.

Check out this [Powerpoint Running List of Identity Art & CS Art](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d07xmsJIjLE-FxyL591-Tkh_9MdchunvTemyzN3PM8w/edit?usp=sharing) for some inspiration. These pieces either:

1. explore or express some aspect of the artist's identity, such as race, gender, culture, religion, etc. (Identity Art)
2. are generated through computer science techniques (Computer Science Art)
3. Or both!


### Deliverables

- Bring a drawing of one idea for your final project. It could be on paper or on your computer.
- *(OPTIONAL)* If you want an extra challenge, add the sketch of your drawing to the `planning.md` file in your unit project repository, commit the change, and push it to git. You can do this by moving the image file to the `images` directory of your project and changing the file path of the image in the `planning.md` file.
- *(OPTIONAL)* Add a slide to the [Class Powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d07xmsJIjLE-FxyL591-Tkh_9MdchunvTemyzN3PM8w/edit?usp=sharing). Include your name, a piece of artwork you found, and the source.

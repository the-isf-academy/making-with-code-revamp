type: notes

+ 10 class meetings
+ This initial unit prioritizes getting students making personally-meaningful things as fast as possible. This means we aren’t aiming for completeness. In particular, we’re not introducing variables or conditional control structures in this unit: most students won’t need them, and we’ll spend a lot of time with them in the next unit.

# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is host to series of mathematical and computational problems. 

There are tons of available problems to solve with a range of difficulty. 

{{< code-action "Create a new folder" >}} in your `cs9` directory to hold your work for each problem. 
```shell
cd Desktop/cs9
mkdir project_euler
cd project_euler
```
{{< code-action "Create a new file for the first problem." >}} Be sure to create a new file for each problem you attempt. 
```shell
atom problem1.py
```

{{< aside "Solutions" >}}
If you are interested in the solutions or learning more about each problem, **create an account**.

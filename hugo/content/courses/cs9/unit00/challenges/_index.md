#### Challenges
Challenges will provide extra goals for students who have already finished
the assigned work and the extensions.
These challenges will require students to apply their coding skills in new ways.

Make sure you have followed the Initial Set Up before selecting a challenge. You are not required to work in order. Feel free to choose one that interests you.

```

{{< code-action "Then create a new folder:" >}}
```shell
mkdir challenges
```

{{< code-action "Now that you have a new folder, go into it." >}}

{{< code-action "First, create a new file." >}} Make sure you are in your `/challenges` directory.
```shell
atom fibonnaci_visualization.py
```

{{< code-action "Copy and paste following into the top of your file to import the Turtle library at the start of the file:" >}}
```python
from turtle import *
```

{{< code-action "Code the fibonacci sequence." >}} If you have already completed this, you can simply copy and paste the code into your new file.

{{< code-action "Now, it's up to you to recreate the image to the best of your ability!" >}} If you have not yet figured out the solution to this problem, now is the tim

{{< code-action "Once you have this complete, add color!" >}} You may want to consider using the `modulo` to create a color pattern. You may also want to explore the [Random Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to ranodm the colors.

Before you begin, consider how you will break the larger problem down into sub-probems.
For example,
1. First try to create *one* star
2. Next try to create a *row* of stars
3. ...
4. ...

{{< code-action "First, create a new file." >}} Make sure you are in your `/challenges` directory.
```shell
atom stars.py
```

{{< code-action "Copy and paste following into the top of your file to import the Turtle library at the start of the file:" >}}
```python
from turtle import *
```


{{< code-action "Now, it's up to you to recreate the image to the best of your ability!" >}}

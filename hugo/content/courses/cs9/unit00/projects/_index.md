# Animation Project

In this project you will make an animated drawing (or a GIF!) using Python's turtle library.

It's up to you to make a drawing you actually care about making. Your teachers will help you choose a project that's a good level of challenge.

Here are a few examples from last year to get you started. More can be found at the `gallery` page.

## [0] Project Management Booklet: Planning 

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front. You are required to fill out the planning section of the Project Booklet and get it approved by a teacher. 


{{< write-action "Fill out the Project Overview and Project Design sections of the Booket." >}}

**ðŸ‘€ Once you have completed your planning document, meet with a teacher to talk through your project.**

##  [1] Starter Code

For this project, your code will live in a git repository. It is your responsibility to regularly commit to your repository.

{{< code-action "Download your respository with starter code for your project." >}}
> replace the `yourGithubUsername` with your Github username.
>
> *example:*
>
> *`git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_animation_emmaqbrown.git`*


```shell
cd ~/Desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit00_drawing/
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_animation_yourGithubUsername.git
```

It contains the following files:
- `project.py` When this program runs, it should draw your project.
- `settings.py` This is where you settings for your animation should be stored.
- `README.md` This is documentation for your project for other people who may want to use your project.


{{< code-action "Start coding your first milestone!" >}} With you design document approved by a teacher and your starter code downloaded, you're ready to start creating.

{{< /columns >}}

**This project will be assessed on the following criteria:**
- project managment
- iterative development
- readability
- abstraction
- decomposition

**For each criteria you will be assessed on a score from 0-3:**
- 0 - no evidence of the practice
- 1 - limited evidence of the practice
- 2 - adequate evidence of the practice
- 3 - substantial evidence of the practice

*To do well in this project, you should be able to concretely demonstrate that you can successfully do each practice*

## Course structures

### Infrastructure

The course will be taught in Python. Each student will do her work primarily in Github repositories. We will use GitHub Classroom to manage assignments. Each project, lab, and problem set will be a separate repo.

### Assessment

Projects and labs will be assessed manually, giving feedback not just on correctness but on style, etc. Problem sets will be graded automatically via GitHub webhooks--every time commits are pushed, the auto-grader will assess the assignment and create or update an Issue giving feedback. We will use pedal to automatically grade problem sets.

## Grading

| Score           | Points | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Full credit     | 3/2    | Completed everything, with flying colors)  |
| Average credit  | 2/2    | Completed everything)                      |
| Subpar          | 1/2    | Not completed or not correctly completed)  |
| No submission   | 0/2    | Or no evidence of good-faith effort        |

Late - deduct 1 point for submissions between 1-7 days late  
We will not accept late submissions after 7 days  
Revised work - If you submit something that you put a good faith effort by the first deadline and you want to revise the homework, we can accept revisions up until the end of the unit.  

When we assess studentsâ€™ work manually, we will give feedback on the following:

+ **Creativity** of the homework submission
+ **Courage** with code -  willingness to experiment / try new things
+ **Effectiveness** of concepts/tools usage -  Appropriate, effective use of tools and concepts (suggest when there could be a better option)
+ **Coding style**
    + Descriptive function and variable naming
    + Documenting the functionality of functions with comments
    + Decomposition of programs into functions
    + Efficiency and elegance of code

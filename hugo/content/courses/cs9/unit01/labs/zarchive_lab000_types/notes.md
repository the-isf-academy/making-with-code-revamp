# Types lab

- Could we refactor this to focus on function execution as where types come from
  and where they go?

- January 4 ISF back at school

## Revisions to types lab

- Emphasize types with regard to interfaces: values coming and going. 
- De-emphasize application of functions over collections, e.g. map, reduce. 
- Refer exclusively to 'classes' and not 'types'. In Python3, there is no
  difference between classes and types. Types have different meanings in other
  languages. This also supports the semantics of `isinstance`.

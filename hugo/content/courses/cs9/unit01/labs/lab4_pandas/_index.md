# Pandas and Matplotlib Lab
In this lab, you will be introduced to two data science Python frameworks, Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## [0] Setup


{{< code-action "Start by cloning your lab repo from Github." >}} Starter code for the lab is provided in the `lab-pandas-matplotlib` repo. 

```shell
cd desktop/cs9/unit_01
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab-pandas-matplotlib-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
```

{{< code-action "Download the required Python packages." >}} 
```shell
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib
```

## [1] Intro to Pandas and Matplotlib

Pandas and Matplotlib are widely used Python frameworks for data science. Pandas is used to analyze large data sets and Matplotlib is used to visualize it. 

{{< code-action "Open Jupyter notebook inside of your repository:" >}} `jupyter notebook`

{{< code-action >}} **Open the `pandas-matplotlib.ipynb` lab in Jupyter** using the window that popped up in your web browser. 

{{< code-action >}} **Complete the lab in the Jupyter notebook.**
> *Each person should work on their own lab, but you can
work together in groups to complete it.*

###  [Deliverables]


{{< deliverables >}}
{{< code-action >}} **For this lab, you should `push` updates to the following files to Github.**

- `pandas-matplotlib.ipynb` file with code for each exercise

## [2] Extension 

In this extension, you will answer research questions about the Pokemon dataset. 

{{< code-action >}} **Open the `sumstats.ipynb` file in the `lab-sumstats` directory**

{{< code-action >}} **At the bottom of the file, use `pandas` and `matplotlib` to answer the following questions about the `pokemon_dataset.csv`.**
- What are the top 5 Pokemon with the highest and lowest speed?
- What are the top 5 strongest non-legendary pokemon? 
- What is the relationship between type 1 and attack?

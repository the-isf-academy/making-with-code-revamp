# 2. Scatter Plot Lab

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit01/01_02_scatter_plot.png" width="400px" >}}


Now that you've gotten to explore Jupyter notebooks, it's time to use one to collaboratively create a scatter plot with your group.

ðŸ’» **In the Jupyter file navigator, open `scatter_plot.Rmb`. Save it and close it and then open `scatter_plot.ipynb`.**

## Reminder about Github collaboration

Just like in the last lab, you'll be working on a single team Github repository for this lab.

Reminder of the basic workflow:

  - `git pull` to get any new changes from the Github repo and merge changes
  - `git status` to determine what has change
  - `git add` to add the files you've edited
  - `git commit` to write a message about what you've changed
  - `git push` to push your changes to Github


ðŸ’» **Have one member of your group make a change to the `scatter_plot` notebook and then make sure everyone can get the changes in their local repositories**
*(Don't forget to start in the `scatter_plot.Rmb` file, save it, and then open the `scatter_plot.ipynb` file)*


## Divide and conquer

In this lab, you'll get to experience the full power of decomposition and abstraction in computer science. Each team member will only write part of your group's final code.

With your group, walk through the `scatter_plot` notebook. Each group member will be assigned a function to create by the teaching team.

Along the way, you may need to figure out how to test your code before your teammates are ready with their functions. You will need to find a way to run your function to test, even though you don't have all of your teammates' code.

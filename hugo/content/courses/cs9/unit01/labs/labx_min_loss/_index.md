# 6. Minimizing Loss Lab

Using the metric we developed to determine how good our lines were, we're going to try to find the best lines we can for the relationship between two variables in our social media data.

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Create a team repository for the lab using the following links:

If you are in **CS 1**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/g/NXMUIVW5).

If you are in **CS 2**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/g/nvYi-TiM).

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Clone the lab repo into your `unit_01` directory, `cd` inside, and run the `jupyter notebook` command.

ðŸ’» **TODO:** In the Jupyter file navigator, open `.Rmb`. Save it and close it and then open `min_loss.ipynb`.

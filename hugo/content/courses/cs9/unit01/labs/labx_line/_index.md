With your new insights into our social media data, we're going to push our analysis of the data forward by
trying to identify trends in the data.

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Create a team repository for the lab using the following links:

If you are in **CS 1**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/gOZWvXCO).

If you are in **CS 2**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/g/D3L_VChz).

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Clone the lab repo into your `unit_01` directory, `cd` inside, and run the `jupyter notebook` command.

ðŸ’» **TODO:** In the Jupyter file navigator, open `line.Rmb`. Save it and close it and then open `line.ipynb`.

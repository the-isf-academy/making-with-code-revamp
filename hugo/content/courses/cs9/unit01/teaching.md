In Unit 1 we will build on the drawing we did in Unit 0, but we will shift our attention from imperative programming to functional programming, and shift our task domain from creative drawing to data science. This will give us an opportunity to practice writing functions, to thoroughly address variables, data types, and how functions can be composed together to solve bigger problems. Furthermore, this unit will ask students to create a different kind of product for their audience: discovery of new facts through data analysis, justification of claims, and consideration of how such arguments can be framed in ways that will feel interesting and important.

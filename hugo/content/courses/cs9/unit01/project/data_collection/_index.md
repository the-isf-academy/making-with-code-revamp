# Data Collection Guides

From the left menu, select whichever service you would like to analyze! Then, follow the instructions to download your data.

## Building out your Dataset

Now that you've got your data, let's build it out and add more columns. 

{{< code-action "Start by cloning this repository into your folder." >}} This repository contains Python scripts to build out the database for each service.
```shell
cd desktop/cs9/unit_01
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data.git
```

> This repository's file system looks like this, with each service having its own folder.
> ```shell
> .
> ├── README.md
> ├── imessage_export
> ├── netflix_export
> ├── whatsapp_export
> ├── spotify_export
> ├── youtube_export
> ```

{{< code-action >}}  **`cd` into the folder for the service you choose.** 
Here you will see:
- a `requirements.txt` file
- a `/data` folder
- a `/export` folder 
- Python script(s)

{{< code-action "Install the necessary requirements inside the service_export folder:" >}}
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

{{< look-action >}} **Then, open the link to the README.md for your specific service. The README.md contains step by step instructions for how to build out your dataset.**
- [Netflix](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/netflix_export) 
- [Spotify](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/spotify_export)
- [Whatsapp](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/whatsapp_export)
- [YouTube](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/courseware-data/tree/master/youtube_export)

{{< code-action "Follow along with the README.md file." >}} If successful, your dataset `.csv` file will be in the `/export` folder.
> *Please notify a teacher if you run into any issues and do not see your dataset.*

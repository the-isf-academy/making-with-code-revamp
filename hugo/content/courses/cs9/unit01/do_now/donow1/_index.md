# Do Now: Functional Programming & Types

You have already met a bunch of different kinds of objects in Python: `1`,
`2.55`, `True`, `"pizza"`, `None`. Each of these has a **type**. When we
talk about what goes in to functions and what comes out, we won't talk about
particular inputs. 
> Who cares if you double `7` or `9`? The point is you can't double `False`.

We'll talk about the **types** of objects that functions operate on. **Everything has a type.** Here are a few types that you already know:

| Type     | Examples        | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `int`    | 145, -200       | Integers, just like you know them from math class :)                                                                                 |
| `float`  | 1.1115, 9.08    | Decimal numbers. They're called `float` because of [how they are stored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)    |
| `str`    | "apple", "x"    | Strings, or sequences of characters. Careful! `5` is an `int` but `"5"` is a `str`.                                                  |
| `bool`   | `True`, `False` | Booleans, or True/False values. Named for George Boole, who spent a lot of time thinking about them.                                 |
| `list`   | `[1, 2, 3]`     | A `list` holds other objects.                   

## Functional Programming

{{< write-action >}} **In your notebook, fill out the `input type(s)` and `output type` for each item in the table below. For each function describe what type the function would take as an input, and what type the function would return as output.**

|   #   | Function                                                         | Input type(s) | Output type |
|------ |------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
|   0   | Square root of a number                                          | float         | float       |
|   1   | Multiplication of two integers                                   |               |             |
|   2   | Average of a list of numbers                                     |               |             |
|   3   | A function that gives all the factors of a number                |               |             |
|   4   | A function to check if a word is a curse word                    |               |             |
|   5   | A function that assigns a friendliness score to a sentence       |               |             |
|   6   | A function that takes a website URL and returns the page content |               |             |
|   7   | A function that counts the number of sentences in a paragraph    |               |             |
|   8   | `>`                                                              |               |             |
|   9   | `==`

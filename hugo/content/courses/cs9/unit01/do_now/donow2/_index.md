## Price Calculator 

Dictionaries are a great way to store information that has a relationship. For example, items and their cost. 

Consider the following dictionary:
```python
grocery_list_hkd = {
    'milk': 28.90,
    'chicken wings': 120,
    'breadcrumbs': 32.50,
    'eggs':23.90,
    'seasoning': 10.50
}
```
> Each `key` is `string` data type, that holds a grocery store item
>
> Each `value` is a `float` data type, that holds the grocery store item's price


{{< code-action "Write a function that can calculate the total cost of each item in the dictionary." >}}
- Parameter: a dictionary with items and prices
- Return value: an float value representing the total cost of each item

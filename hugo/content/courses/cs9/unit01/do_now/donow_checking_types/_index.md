## Do Now: Checking Types

Python has built in functions to check types. Let's experiment with them by using the Python shell.

{{< code-action "Enter the Python Shell, by openning the Terminal and type:" >}} `python3`

> {{< write-action >}} **In your notebook, fill out the `Return Value` for each item in the table below.** For each code snippet, record its return value. *If there is no return value, write 'None'*

|   #   | Code Snippet                                                        | Return Value| 
|------ |------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
|   0   | isinstance(5, int)                                        | True         | 
|   1   | isinstance('40.2',int)                                 |               |  
|   2   | isinstance(False,str)                                    |               |   
|   3   | isinstance('peanuts',bool)               |               |      
|   4   | isinstance('turtle',str)               |               |     
|   5   | type(True)     |               |   
|   6   | type('the beatles') |               |   
|   7   | type([0,3,'apples'])    |               |     
|   8   | assert 1 + 2 == 3                         |               |       
|   9   | assert 1 + 2 == 4|               |   
|   10   | assert isinstance("cowboy", int) |               |   
|   10   | assert 10!='10'|               |

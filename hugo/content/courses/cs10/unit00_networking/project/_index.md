## [0] Project Management Sheet

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front.
Before you start working on your project, you are required to complete the both tabs of the Project Management Sheet.

{{< code-action >}} **Find your project management sheet in your Google Drive folder: "Networking Project Management Sheet".** Share the sheet with your group member(s)

{{< write-action "Fill out the both tabs." >}} Once you're completed, meet with a teacher to discuss your idea before beginning to code.

{{< aside "A few ideas..." >}}

- collaborative story telling (poetry, madlibs, etc.)
- collaboarative art project with emojis, symbols, or [ASCII art](https://www.asciiart.eu/)
- collaborative messaging board

## [1] Starter Code


In this lab, you will be working in groups, storing your shared code in your group's repository.

{{< code-action "Download your repository with starter code for your project." >}}

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs10/unit00_networking/
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_networking_group#.git
cd project_networking_group#
```
> replace `#` with your group number


{{< code-action "Enter the poetry shell." >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

{{< code-action "Install requirements" >}}
```shell
poetry install
```

{{< code-action "Install Banjo" >}}
```shell
pip3 install django-banjo
```

It contains the following :
- A `project_networking` repository containing the following:
  - `\app`
    - `models.py` - This is where you will define your model.
    - `views.py` - This is where you will define your routes and endpoints.
  - `database.sqlite` - This is your database file.
  - `README.md` - This is documentation for the backend of your project.
  - `client.py` - This is how the User will interact wiht your server.

{{< code-action "Start coding your first milestone!" >}} With you project management sheet approved by a teacher and your starter code downloaded, you're ready to start creating.

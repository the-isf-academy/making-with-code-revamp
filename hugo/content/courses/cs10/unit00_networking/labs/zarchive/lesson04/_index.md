## TCP/IP simulation
If we are not in person, use a CLI-based version of this lab, using the
Raspberry Pis (or just a laptop if people get stuck). 

## Tree problem set
- Introduce problem sets
- Building off of our TCP/IP simulation, imagine much larger networks of people. 
  - We can represent networks as trees. Draw a couple. 
  - Math with trees. If you have a network with depth D and each node can have N
    children, how many nodes are supported?
  - Provide a simulation of a traversable tree and have students practice 
    breadth-first search and depth-first search. Then write out the algorithm
    precisely. 
  - Provide an example of a proof by negation that breadth-first search will
    find any node in the network. Then ask students to write a similar proof for
    depth-first search.

## Work on final project proposal 

## Problem set 2
- Get started; you will have some time to meet and talk through the problem set
  next class. 
- Cyclic and acyclic graphs. If we are going to write microservices, they might
  depend on other microservices. 
  - Draw out a dependency tree for a given scenario. 
  - If there is a cycle in the dependency tree, we have a problem. Write out an
    algorithm for checking to make sure there is no cycle.

## Mesh Networks
Currently, the mesh network is not bridgable except via ethernet. To explore the network, you
will need to connect to one of the Pis over ethernet and share with the class.

## Troubleshooting


## If students finish early
Students can take a stab at writing the DFS and BFS functions in Python. Check out the
`lab-algorithms` repo on github for a graph and search algorithm implementation.

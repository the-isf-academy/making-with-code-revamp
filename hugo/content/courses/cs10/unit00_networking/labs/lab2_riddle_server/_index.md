# Riddle Server

In this lab we are going to learn how the riddle server is made using Banjo.

## [0] Set Up

You are each able to run a locally hosted riddle server on your laptop using Banjo.

{{< code-action "Start by going into the unit folder" >}}
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs10/unit00_networking/
```

{{< code-action "Clone the lab folder." >}} Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Github username.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_riddle_server_YOUR_USERNAME
```

{{< code-action "Go into the lab folder." >}} 
```shell
cd lab_riddle_server_YOUR_USERNAME
```


{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry shell" >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

{{< code-action "Install requirements" >}}
```shell
poetry install
```

{{< code-action "Install Banjo" >}}
```shell
pip3 install django-banjo
```

## [1] Local Riddle Server

You are each able to run a locally hosted riddle server on your laptop using Banjo.

### [Starting the Server]

{{< code-action "Now, let's start your local server." >}}
```shell
banjo
```
```shell

Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

### [Accessing the Server]

{{< look-action " You can now visit this server in your web browser, just as you did with the riddler server hosted on the internet: " >}} [http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/all](http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/all)

**In order to send requests to the other endpoints, you will need always have 2 Terminal windows open.**
- 1 window will run the server
- 1 window will send `HTTP` requests

{{< code-action "Open another Terminal window." >}} You can either open a new tab, `command+t`, or open a new window with `command+n`.

{{< code-action "View all the riddles in the second Terminal window." >}}
```shell
http get http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/all
```

{{< look-action " Look at the Terminal window running the server. Notice how it recorded your request." >}}
```shell
[16/Sep/2022 02:44:20] "GET /riddles/all HTTP/1.1" 200 1069
```

Your version of the riddle server only has the 2 endpoints:
- `/riddles/all`
- `/riddles/guess`

{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action "Explore both endpoints via the Terminal and be sure to successfully:" >}}
- view all riddles without the answers
- guess a riddle
{{< /checkpoint >}}

## [2] What is Banjo?

This server is written using [Banjo](https://cs.fablearn.org/docs/banjo/index.html), a wrapper for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It allows users to quickly create models with a persistant database and API.

Banjo apps must have an `app` folder. Within the app folder must be two files: `models.py`, `views.py`. The `database.sqlite` file is created when the server is first started. It is stored at the same level as `app`. Here is an example file structure:
```shell
lab_riddle_server
|
└──app
|   ├──models.py
|   └──views.py
└──database.sqlite
```
- `models.py` - A model is essentially an abstracted class. Just as a class has properties, a model has fields. When defining a model's fields, you must specify the data type.
- `views.py` - The views are where you define the API functionality. Here is where you decide what the `endpoints` are and the type of `HTTP` request it will require.

**In this lab, we are going to be primarily focused on the `views.py` file.**

---

## [3] Writing Routes

In this lab, you will build out the full functionality of the Riddle server. Currently, your file only has `riddles/all` and `riddle/guess`. 

**It is up to you to add the following endpoints:**
- `riddles/one`
- `riddles/new`
- `riddle/random`



{{< code-action "Start by opening up the primary folder:" >}} `app`

```shell
atom app
```

{{< code-action >}} **Open the `views.py` file.** Here is where you will write the additional endpoints. 

---

### [riddles/one]

{{< code-action >}} **Write the `riddles/one` endpoint.** 
- http: `get`
- payload: `id`
- return: a single `Riddle` with the `question`, `guesses`, and `correct` properties

{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action >}} **Test the `riddles/one` endpoint in a separate Terminal window from the server..**

```shell
http get http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/one id=0
```

{{< /checkpoint >}}

---

### [riddles/new]

{{< code-action >}} **Write the `riddles/new` endpoint.** 
- http: `post`
- payload: `question` and `answer`
- return: a single `Riddle` with the `question`, `guesses`, and `correct` properties

{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action >}} **Test the `riddles/new` endpoint in a separate Terminal window from the server..**

```shell
http post http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/new question="It goes up and down the stairs without moving." answer="A carpet"
```

{{< /checkpoint >}}

---

### [riddles/random]

{{< code-action >}} **Write the `riddles/random` endpoint.** 
- http: `get`
- return: a single `Riddle` with the `question`,  `correct`, and `guess` properties 

{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action >}} **Test the `riddles/random` endpoint in a separate Terminal window from the server..**

```shell
http get http://127.0.0.1:5000/riddles/random 
```

{{< /checkpoint >}}

**Once you've successfully completed the worksheet be sure to fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8yjSaASsdDp2y4Zawso8Ko77nkhPH6ADf5BOTpPcO_kdtDw/viewform?usp=sf_link).**

{{< /deliverables >}}

---

## [5] Extension

Currently, there's not way to see the answer unless you correctly guess the riddle. 

{{< code-action >}} **Write an endpoint that has the ability to view the solution of a given Riddle.** 
> *Hint: a new method in the `Riddle` class may be useful*

It should return `JSON` that looks something like:
```shell
{
    "riddle": [
        {
            "correct": 0,
            "guesses": 3,
            "id": 1,
            "question": "It goes up and down the stairs without moving.",
            "answer": "A carpet"
        }
    ]
}
```

{{< code-action >}} **Write an endpoint that has the ability to change the question or answer or a riddle.** 
> *Consider, what kind of HTTP request would be best for this?*

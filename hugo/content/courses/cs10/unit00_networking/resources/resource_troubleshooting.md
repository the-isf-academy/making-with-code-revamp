type: resource

This resource will walk you through what to do if something goes wrong. We will continue
documenting problems we run into here over the course of the year. If you find and fix a
problem that's not documented here, let us know by [describing the problem and solution in
an issue on the website Github repository](https://github.com/cproctor/making-with-code/issues/new).

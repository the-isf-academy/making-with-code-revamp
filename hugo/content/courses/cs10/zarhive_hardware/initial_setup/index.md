# Initial setup

Welcome back to Making With Code! We have changed some of the course software this year, 
so you'll need to do a bit of setup to get ready for the year. 
If you get stuck or are unsure what to do, ask {{< teacher >}}. Everyone's system is 
different, so the initial setup sometimes needs some TLC. 
You should only ever have to run these instructions once. 

## The basics
To get your computer ready, we need to configure the workspace you will use for the class. Select the tab for your operating system and follow the instructions. Please let {{< teacher >}} know if you run into any issues. 


{{< tabs "computer-setup" >}}
{{< tab "MacOS" >}}

Start by installing the latest version of Python. [Open this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), 
click "Download Python," and follow the installation instructions.

Once the installation finishes, you will see a Finder window showing what was installed. 
(If you closed the window, open Finder, click on "Applications," and then "Python 3.10" (or whatever
version of Python you just installed).

Double-click on "Install Certificates.command" and then 
"Update Shell Profile.command". Each of these will open a Terimal window and run a bunch of commands. 
Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

{{< aside >}}
If you see a red "Permission denied" error message when running "Install Certificates.command", open a 
Terminal window and run `sudo "/Applications/Python 3.10/Install Certificates.command"` instead. You will be asked 
for an administrator password; you won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.

for Windows users that we'll explain along the way.

## Install MWC

{{< code-action "Open Terminal and run the following command." >}}
`mwc` is a special program we wrote for this class which will help you set up your assignments.

```shell
pip3 install making-with-code-cli
```
{{< aside >}}
If this doesn‚Äôt work, try running `sudo pip3 install making-with-code-cli` or `pip3 install --user making-with-code-cli`. Still no luck? Talk to {{< teacher >}}. 
{{</ aside >}}

## Configure MWC

{{< code-action "Run the following command." >}}
You will be asked some questions to finish the setup process. A few notes:
- We suggest accepting default values for now. You can change your settings later by re-running 
  `mwc setup`.
- You'll be asked for the Making With Code URL. That's this site, `{{< baseurl >}}`.
- When you are asked for your computer password, you won't see any letters appear as you type. 
  This is normal--it's to keep the person standing behind you from seeing your password.

```shell
mwc setup
```

Congratuations! You're finished. We won't continue until everyone gets set up. Can you help 
someone else?

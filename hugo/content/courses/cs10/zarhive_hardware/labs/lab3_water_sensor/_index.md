# Water Quality Sensors

In this lab you will act as an aquarium monitoring system using water quality sensors and Raspberry Pis.

In pairs, you are responsible for writing a program that utilizies the provided sensor to collect water quality information over the course of 24 hours.

Each group will monitor `Dissolved Oxygen`, `PH`, or `Conductivity` for both the fish tank on A4 and a control tank in A403.

We will then compile and share the data with the ISF science faculty.


## [0] Setup

Let's start by taking a look at the sensors. There are three available sensors, each with its own data sheet. A data sheet is an informational document provided by the manufacturer with details of the performance and properties of a product.

- [Dissolved Oxygen Sensor](https://files.atlas-scientific.com/DO_EZO_Datasheet.pdf)
- [PH Sensor](https://files.atlas-scientific.com/pH_EZO_Datasheet.pdf)
- [Conductivity Sensor](https://files.atlas-scientific.com/EC_EZO_Datasheet.pdf)


**Each kit should have:**
- 1  sensor
- 1 EZO carrier board
- 1 EZO conductivity circut
- 1-2 calibration solutions

Refer to the 2 diagrams below and follow the steps:

0. Carrier Board `RX` connected to Raspberry Pi `GPIO 3 (SCL)`
0. Carrier Board `TX` connected to Raspberry Pi `GPIO 2 (SCA)`
0. Carrier Board `GND` connected to any Raspberry Pi `Ground` Pin
0. Carrier Board `VCC` connected to any Raspberry Pi `3v3 power` Pin

### [Starter Code]

{{< code-action "SSH into your Raspberry Pi" >}} with `ssh YOUR_USERNAME@rasperrypi-N`

> Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the user your created.
>   
> Replace `N` with your Raspberry Pi number.

{{< code-action "Clone the lab repository" >}} in your `cs10\unit_00` folder and install the requirements.

```shell
cd cs10/unit_00
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab-water-quality-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
pip3 install pytz
```

The `lab-water-quality` repository contains the following:
- Software provided by Atlas Scientific, the manufacturer of the sensors
    - `AtlastI2C.py` - a Python file with a Class to control with the sensors
- `data_tank.csv` - a file that will stores the data collected from the fish tank
- `data_control.csv` - a file that will store the data collected from the control tank
- `sensor_interface.py` - a Python file that handles the collection of data over the course of 24 hours for your given sensor
- `README.md` - instructions for how to use your `data_collection.py` file. Another user should be able to easily use your program to run their own data analysis

## [1] Sensor Interface

Your goal is to expand the functionality of `sensor_interface.py` to the specifications of the project.

{{< code-action "Start by running" >}} `sensor_interface.py`

```shell
python3 sensor_interface.py
```

Currently, the program only polls the data once. It is your job to ensure it polls over 24 hours.
```shell
Success 100: 0
```

{{< code-action "Let's take a look at" >}} `data_tank.csv`
```shell
cat data_tank.csv
```

Currently, it only stores the date of the data polled. It is your job to ensure it stores all of the necessary information.
```shell
data
14-09-2021
```

**Your `sensor_interface.py` must include the following functionalities:**
- Poll every 15 minutes for 24 hours
- Write to a `.csv` file that stores the following each time the sensor is polled:
    - the date
    - the time
    - the type of data the sensor collects
    - the *parsed* data



{{< checkpoint >}}
**In your notebook with your partner, write the pseudocodoe to achieve this functionality.**

Take a look at the exisiting code and consider the following:
- How will you determine how frequently the data is polled?
- How will you stop the data from polling after 24 hours?
- How and when will you save the *parsed* data to the csv?

Review your pseudocode with a teacher before moving on.
{{< /checkpoint >}}


### [Adding the time]

Let's start by adding the extending the functionality of what data is stored in the `.csv` file. 

{{< checkpoint >}}
**In your notebook with your partner, imagine how your `.csv` file will be formatted by creating a sample table.**
{{< /checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action "With your sample table in mind, start by implementing the functionality to store the time" >}}


{{< aside "Resources" >}}

- Take a look at [this](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) resource for details about the `strftime()` function of the `datetime` library.
- Take a look at [this](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/csv) resource for details about the `csv` library.
{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Test your implementation of storing the time." >}}

When you run  `cat data_tank.csv` in Terminal, you should see something like:
```shell
data,time
14-09-2021,08:50:27
```


### [Adding the data]

Now, let's add the functionality of storing the data type and the parsed data points to the `.csv` file.

{{< code-action "Implement the functionality to store the data type in the first row" >}}

{{< code-action "Then, implement the functionality to store each parsed data point." >}} Currently the program prints if the sensor was able to successfully read the data point. However, for the csv, we simply want the number measured.


{{< aside "Tip" >}}
Take a look at the functionalites of the `AtlasI2C` class.

*There may be some helpful methods.*
{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Test your implementation of storing the data" >}}

When you run  `cat data_tank.csv` in Terminal, you should see something like:
```shell
data,time,EC
14-09-2021,08:50:27,100
```
*`EC` and `100` will differ depending on your data type and measured data*


### [Extend the Polling]

{{< code-action "Finally, implement the functionality to poll data in increments over a perioid of time." >}}

Eventually we'll be polling data every 15 minutes for 24 hours. 

But for now, make sure your implementation is well abstracted. That way you can run small tests to see if it works. This will also aid you as you test the `.csv` functionalites.

For example, if you poll data every 10 seconds for 60 seconds, you should see something like this:
```shell
data,time,EC
14-09-2021,08:50:27,100
14-09-2021,09:00:27,100
14-09-2021,09:10:27,100
14-09-2021,09:20:27,100
14-09-2021,09:30:27,100
14-09-2021,09:40:27,100
14-09-2021,09:50:27,100
```

{{< checkpoint >}}
Before moving on, demonstrate your fully functioning `sensor_interface.py` file.

In your notebook, answer the following prompt:
- Why are you certain your program will work for any increment over any amount of time?
{{< /checkpoint >}}

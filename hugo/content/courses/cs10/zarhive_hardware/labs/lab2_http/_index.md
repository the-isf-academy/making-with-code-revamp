# HTTP: How Computers Communicate

The Internet may be humanity's most profound invention. A global
network of computers talking to one another, making it possible for people all
over the world to interact. In this lab, we will start learning about *how*
computers talk with one another. 

## Vocabulary

- A **protocol** is a set of rules for how to behave or communicate. 
  Human speech has many protocols: when you must be serious and when you may tell jokes; 
  when you must show respect and when you may be warm and friendly. Human
  protocols are usually somewhat flexible, but computer protocols are usually very
  strict. Either you follow all the rules or communication fails. 
- **Hypertext** was an early word for webpage content--it's "hyper"
  because any part of the text can be a link connecting to other texts, just
  like the way ideas spark other ideas. 
- **HTTP** stands for "**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**." It's a set of rules for how
  computers ask each other for content, and how they reply. 
- **HTML** stands for "**Hypertext Markup Language**," the grammar of websites.
  HTML is a code full of tags like `<body>` and `<div>`. Putting it all
  together, HTTP describes how comptuers ask each other for content; HTML describes 
  how they should format the content when sending web pages. 


## [1] The Basic Rules of HTTP
Every time you visit a URL, your computer opens a connection with the server at that address and uses **HTTP** to send and recieve the content. 

### [Requests]
Communication starts when one computer (the client) sends a *request* to another computer (the server). For example, by visiting "cs.fablearn.org" you initiate
a `GET` request to recieve the *Making with Code* homepage from the server. 

A `GET` request contains following: 

```shell
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cs.fablearn.org
```

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/00_http_get.png" width="100%" title="An HTTP GET request" >}}

Another frequently utilized request is a `POST` request. A `POST` Request is sent when you are sending data to the server. For example, logging into an account or making an online purchase. 

In the `POST` request below, the webpage would contain a form to recieve the user's data. 

```shell
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: social_media_login.com
```

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/00_http_post.png" width="100%" title="An HTTP POST request" >}}

### [Responses]

Once the request has been recieved by the server, it responds by sending the client a HTTP *response*. If a successful connection has been made, the server sends the content to the client. 

Here's an example of a HTTP response to a successful `GET` request to the course website:

  ```shell {linenos=table}
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK                                 // This is the response
  Content-Length: 2081                            // I am sending a lot
  Content-Type: text/html                         // I am sending HTML
  Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2020 19:23:28 GMT             // This is when I sent it
  Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Aug 2020 15:46:28 GMT    // There is new content
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>                                 // Here it comes!
  <html lang="en">                                // Here is your webpage
      . . . 
  <p><em>Making with Code</em> is a new, old 
  approach to teaching computer science 
  based in Constructionism.</p>
      . . .
  ```
- `200` (line 1) is the response status code. 
- `Content-Length` (line 2), `Content-Type`(line 3), `Date`(line 4), and `Last-Modified`(line 5) are response headers. They provide
  more detail about what is being requested and what is being sent back. For example, the `Content-Type` tells your computer what
  type of data is being recieved. For "cs.fablearn.org", your computer recieves the HTML, Javacsript, CSS, and image files that make
  up the homepage of the site. 
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` (line 7) is the beginning of the content sent with the response. This is the HTML of the course website which your
  browser then renders as a webpage.

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/00_http_response.png" width="100%" title="An HTTP response" >}}

### [Status Codes]
Status codes are used to signal how the communication between the client and the server is going.

**Common HTTP Status Codes**
- `200` means success.
- `300` means you're looking in the wrong place
- `400` means you did something wrong.
- `404` means the resource requested could not be found 
- `500` means, "Sorry, the server broke!" 



{{< code-action "To see status codes in action:" >}} 

0. Right click on any website and click "Inspect"
0. Select "Network" from the top tool bar in the devleoper tools
0. Hard refresh your page with "Command + Shift + R"
0. Find the URL under "Name"
0. Under the "Status" column you will see "200", signifiying a sucessful **GET** request


{{< aside "FYI" >}}
**All actions on the Internet are composed of HTTP Requests.** 

 - Every time you access a website, it triggers a series of HTTP Requests depending on its complexity. 
 - Every time a client requests information from a server, the request is recorded along with the status code.

{{<expand "An Analogy to better understand HTTP Requests" >}}
It can be tricky to understand how HTTP functions because it’s difficult to examine what your browser is actually doing. (And perhaps also because we explained it using acronyms that may be new to you.) Let’s review what we learned by using an analogy that could be more familiar to you.

Imagine the internet is a town. You are a client and your address determines where you can be reached. Businesses in town, such as Codecademy.com, serve requests that are sent to them. The other houses are filled with other clients like you that are making requests and expecting responses from these businesses in town. This town also has a crazy fast mail service, an army of mail delivery staff that can travel on trains that move at the speed of light.

Suppose you want to read the morning newspaper. In order to retrieve it, you write down what you need in a language called HTTP and ask your local mail delivery staff agent to retrieve it from a specific business. The mail delivery person agrees and builds a railroad track (connection) between your house and the business nearly instantly, and rides the train car labeled “TCP” to the address of the business you provided.

Upon arriving at the business, she asks the first of several free employees ready to fulfill the request. The employee searches for the page of the newspaper that you requested but cannot find it and communicates that back to the mail delivery person.

The mail delivery person returns on the light speed train, ripping up the tracks on the way back, and tells you that there was a problem “404 Not Found.” After you check the spelling of what you had written, you realize that you misspelled the newspaper title. You correct it and provide the corrected title to the mail delivery person.

This time the mail delivery person is able to retrieve it from the business. You can now read your newspaper in peace until you decide you want to read the next page, at which point, you would make another request and give it to the mail delivery person.

## [2] Riddle Server

In this lab we are going to practice getting and sending HTTP requests. Let's begin by using a nice little tool called `httpie`. 

{{< code-action "Install httpie by typing the following into Terminal on your personal computer:" >}}  

```shell
pip3 install httpie
```

{{< code-action "Let's explore the Riddle server by typing the below HTTP request into your terminal." >}} Replace `IP_ADDRESS_GIVEN_BY_TEACHER` with the IP address on the board.

```shell
http GET IP_ADDRESS_GIVEN_BY_TEACHER:5000/riddles/all
```

You should see something like this: 
```shell
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Length: 102
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 09 Sep 2020 21:06:24 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.5.2

{
    "riddles": [
        {
            "correct": 0,
            "guesses": 0,
            "id": 1,
            "question": "What month of the year has 28 days?"
        }
    ]
}
```

{{< code-action "Do you know the answer? Try posting a guess via the Terminal." >}}

Note that we are now using a different URL, `IP_ADDRESS_GIVEN_BY_TEACHER:5000/riddles/guess`, because we want to guess the answer to a riddle. 

It is common for `POST` requests to send a *payload* with the request. In this case, the payload is a parameter called `id` specifying which riddle we are guessing, as well as `guess`.

```shell
http POST IP_ADDRESS_GIVEN_BY_TEACHER:5000/riddles/guess id=1 guess="All of them"
```

You should see something like this:
```shell
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Length: 149
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 09 Sep 2020 21:06:54 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.5.2

{
    "correct": true,
    "guess": "All of them",
    "riddle": {
        "correct": 1,
        "guesses": 1,
        "id": 1,
        "question": "What month of the year has 28 days?"
    }
}
```

### [Explore the Endpoints]
Server APIs often rely on different URL *endpoints* to determine what the API should do.

Here is a cheatsheet of the Riddle endpoints, what parameters they take in their payload, and what they do:

| Method | URL                                | Required Payload     | Action                                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `138.68.28.249:5000/riddles/all`   |                      | Returns a list of all the riddles, without answers.                                      |
| `GET`  | `138.68.28.249:5000/riddles/one`   | `id`                 | Returns the riddle if it exists. (Otherwise, it returns an error with status code 404.)  |
| `POST` | `138.68.28.249:5000/riddles/new`   | `question`, `answer` | Creates a new riddle (with an automatically-assigned id). Returns the riddle.            |
| `POST` | `138.68.28.249:5000/riddles/guess` | `id`, `guess`        | Checks whether the guess is correct. In the response, `correct` is `True` or `False`.    |

{{< code-action "Continue to guess riddles and also try adding your own riddles to the server." >}} 

<hr>

### [Host Your Private Riddle Server]

As of now, you've been accessing the riddle server that's hosted on one of the teacher's computers. Let's try hosting the riddle server on your own computer. 

{{< code-action "Clone the riddle server repository into your" >}} `cs10` **folder.**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cproctor/riddle_server.git
cd riddle_server
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

{{< code-action "Run the server." >}} 
```shell
./run.sh
```
 
{{< code-action "Find your IP Address" >}} to access the server and to allow others to access it.The below command will return an IP Address such as `192.168.86.107`.

```shell
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

{{< code-action "Open a new Terminal window" >}} and access your locally hosted riddle server.

```shell
http GET YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000/riddles/all
```

{{< code-action "Create riddles on your own server. Then, share your IP Addresses with your classmates so they can guess." >}} 

{{< checkpoint >}}
Before moving on, answer the following prompts in your notebook:

- What is the difference between a `GET` request and a `POST` request?
- Give an example of when you make a `GET` request in your daily life. 
- Give an example of when you make a `POST` request in your daily life. 
- Why are the riddles not saves across servers? 
{{< /checkpoint >}}

## [3] APIs

{{< code-action "Try visting the Riddle server address" >}}  `IP_ADDRESS_GIVEN_BY_TEACHER:5000/riddles/all` in your web browser. 

You should see something like this:

`{"riddles":[{"correct":1,"guesses":1,"id":1,"question":"What month of the year has 28 days?"}]}`

**Just like with every other website you visit in your browser, to access the Riddle server, your browser sends a `GET` request to the server address. The server resonds with data, and your browser displays it. In this case, the data is all of the riddles in JSON format.**

You might notice that this is not a very pretty or readable representation. That's because the Riddle server is not really meant to be accessed like a webpage. Instead, **the Riddle server is set up as a standalone API (application programming interface)**. APIs are often the backend of applications, and they allow you to interact strictly with the application data without
worrying about the graphical interface. This kind of interface is particularly useful when you are trying to send and
recieve large amounts of data or make many HTTP requests to access similar types of data.

For example, [Wikipedia has an API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) that let's you access information
about Wikipedia pages without having to go through the graphic interface. If your wanted to see all of the pages that
link to a particular wiki page, going through the graphical interface would be nearly impossible. However, the API
provides an easy way to find this information:

```shell
http GET https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php action==query list==backlinks format==json bltitle==Independent_Schools_Foundation_Academy
```

There are lots of [interesting APIs](https://www.twilio.com/blog/cool-apis) that you can use to make some pretty cool projects.

{{< code-action "Explore what APIs the internet has to offer and practice making" >}} `GET` and `POST` **requests.**



## [4] Writing a client
Since the riddle server is an API with no user interface, we end up writing a lot of
HTTP requests into the Terminal to use it. What if we had a program which took care
of making these requests for us? A program like this is called a *client*. Any
app which uses the Internet is a client; it is constantly making HTTP requests
to a server to send and receive information. 

### [Setup]

{{< code-action "Clone the starter repository and install the required libraries" >}} 

```shell
cd cs10/unit_00
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab-http-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
cd lab-http
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

{{< code-action "Now try running the client." >}} 

```shell
python3 client.py
```

It runs! Until it doesn't. The view is fully-functional, however the some of the `Game` class functions still need to be written to connect the game to a Riddle server.

**Your job is to finish the functions in `client.py` which haven't been written yet:**
- `show_riddle()`
- `add_riddle()`
- `guess_riddle()`


### [Making Requests]
You will need to create a request to the server using the requests library like this:
```python
r = requests.get(address, json=payload)
response = r.json()
```
- `address` is the address you want to send the request to. Use the `server_address` property of the game class as the base address for your HTTP requests. You will still need to add on an endpoint to achieve the correct functionality.
- `payload` should be a dictionary containing the parameters you want to send with your HTTP request.
For example, if you wanted to send the parameter `fruit` with the value `watermelon`, you would use:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "fruit": "watermelon"
    }
    ```
- `response = r.json()` converts the response from the server, `r`, into a dictionary
    ```python
    response = r.json()
    ```

### [show_riddle()]
{{< code-action "Code this function to show the riddle the user requested." >}} by using the user requested `id` of the riddle to be displayed.

You can check your implementation of this function by running:
```python
python3 test_lab.py -k show
```


### [add_riddle()]
{{< code-action "Code this function to add a riddle to the server" >}}  by getting a question and an answer from the
user and then sending that information to the server in an HTTP request.

You can check your implementation of this function by running:
```python
python3 test_lab.py -k add
```

### [guess_riddle()]
{{< code-action "Code this function to allow the user to guess a riddle" >}} and send the guess to the server for checking. 
- If the guess was correct, the score should increment and a "correct guess" message should be displayed.
- Otherwise, a "wrong guess" message should be displayed.

You can check your implementation of this function by running:
```python
python3 test_lab.py -k guess
```



**Tips:**
- The `r` Response object returned by the server has many different properties that may be useful
in determining if the request was successful. You can read about the properties of Response objects
in the [documentation for the Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-status-codes). 

{{< checkpoint >}}
Once everyone in your group has a fully-functional client, check in with a
teacher. 
{{< /checkpoint >}}


### [5] Deliverables

{{< deliverables "For this lab, you should push your lab-http repository containing updates to"  >}}
- `client.py`

<br>
Check in with the teacher and demonstrate your working client!
{{< /deliverables >}}

## [5] Extension

### [Error messages]
The functions you wrote for the previous sections probably assume that the server will
respond successfully to your requests. However, sometimes the server might give an error
if the user tries to put in incorrect riddles or guesses.

{{< code-action "Edit your functions above to make sure they display error messages" >}} if the server responds with an error.

You can test your error messages by running:
```python
python3 test_lab.py -k errors
```

### [Make it even better]
Here are a few ideas:

- Display the riddles' difficulty. 
- Give the player prizes, or let them unlock secret modes, if they get a high
  enough score.
- Track the player's correct and incorrect guesses and give the player 
  riddles of the appropriate difficulty. (Hint: `Riddle.difficulty`, 
  defined in [riddle_server/riddles/model.py, line 98](https://github.com/cproctor/riddle_server/blob/3412a4a1043fc591dfc46541be9060ad271ae374/riddles/model.py#L98),
  may be useful. You can calculate a player's skill the same way we calculate a
  riddle's difficulty.)




<!-- ## E. Your own Riddle server

The Riddle server is a pretty simple program. While it is running, it waits for
requests to come in and responds when they do. Let's set it up on your Raspberry
Pi.

{{< code-action >}} First clone and install the Riddle server on your Raspberry Pi:

```shell
$ cd cs10/unit_00
$ git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy-lab-http-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
$ cd lab-http
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd riddle-server
$ ls
riddles    riddles.db run.sh
```

{{< code-action >}} Now run the Riddle server. 

```shell
./run.sh
```

You will see the server's startup message, and then it will sit there, waiting.
Try accessing the server from your laptop. You need to know the Pi's IP address, 
and then use port 5000, something like `192.168.1.204:5000`. Ask a friend for
their Pi's IP address and try accessing their Riddle server. 

You will see an access log as clients access your Riddle server. When you are
ready to shut it down, press `Control + C`.

{{< checkpoint >}}
Once everyone in your group has deployed the Riddle server to their Pi, accessed
someone else's Riddle server, and had someone access theirs, check in with a
teacher. 
{{< /checkpoint >}}

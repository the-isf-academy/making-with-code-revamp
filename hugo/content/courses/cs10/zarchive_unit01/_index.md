This mini-unit will explore the implementation of data structures as objects.
Over the course of the unit, students will develop a queue structure to
compete with the Python implentations of the a List and Deque.

Along the way, students will review object-oriented programming as they
implement their queues as Python objects. Additionally, students
will learn about time- and memory-based efficiency as they attempt to
design queue interfaces which are fast and efficient.

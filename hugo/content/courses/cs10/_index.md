## Curriculum

{{< expand "Unit 0: Networking" >}}

Perhaps even more than through computational power, computers have transformed our lives through networking. This unit explores how computers interact with each other and will give us opportunities to think about the behavior of larger systems, including how our lives are touched by computer networks.

{{< expand "Unit 2: Entrepreneurship" >}}
This unit will consider what students can actually do with computers, and will
serve as a capstone of the two-year sequence. Students will develop a hardware
or software product designed either to be profitable or to solve a social
problem. All projects must involve interaction with real-world potential
clients. The unit will address human-computer interaction and design and prototyping
methodologies, including the use of logging and analytics for quantitative user
research.

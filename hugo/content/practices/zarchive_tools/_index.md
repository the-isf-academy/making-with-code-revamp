We believe learning to utilize computer science tools is an important way that students
connected with and contribute to the world of practicing computer scientists. By learning
to use tools that are commonplace in industry, academia, and open-source computer science
practice, students are both more conneccted to the culture of computer science and more
prepared to take one roles as computer scientists.

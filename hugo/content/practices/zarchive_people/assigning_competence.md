# Assigning competence

+ **Assigning competence:** Create practices by which students are seen as experts.  
    + One useful practice that embodies this: when helping people from the queue, follow up helping a student by saying, “It looks like you understand this issue pretty well now. When I see another student having the same problem, may I send them to you for help?” That way, the student solidifies the understanding by teaching someone else, and gets to be an expert at that issue. You can then keep directing students to that expert for days.

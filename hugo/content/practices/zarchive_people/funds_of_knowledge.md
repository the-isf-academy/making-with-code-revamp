**Funds of knowledge** refers to the idea that we will look at students as having lots of resources they can deploy in their learning (rather than viewing them in terms of their deficits). This also means we need to let go of the idea that we’re solely in the position of determining what’s worthwhile in CS. Our students are going to create things that are worthwhile and successful on their terms, not ours. We are going to support them, while also being warmly demanding. This is not a radical proposition, especially in CS: It’s such a new field that nobody really knows what CS is or what its boundaries are. If we’re finding ways of working that are effective, thinking about ideas that feel powerful, and making things that feel like they matter, then we’re doing the right thing.

# Groupwork

+ **Groupwork:** Small groups are an important context for high-quality disciplinary talk. When students get to choose their groups, they can take advantage of existing social relationships. However, this can create in equities (the strongest students cluster together) and can also bring social tensions into the classroom.
    + Our recommendation is to always assign seats and groups, change groups regularly (perhaps every unit), and allow students some private input (eg “I really don’t get along with X”).

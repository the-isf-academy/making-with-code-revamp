# Labs

Students will work on labs in class which integrate the skills and emphasize developing collaborative problem-solving. Early in the year, labs and projects will be tightly-integrated; students will be guided through creating projects. One feature of labs is that we will be providing some of the libraries students use, allowing them to interact with broader computational systems than they would be able to do on their own. For example, students will initially encounter machine library through functions we provide which allow them to do powerful things with their code.

# Making with Code


*Making with Code* is a new, old approach to teaching computer science. It is based in the educational theory of Constructionism. It's new because it draws on the tools of modern computational practice and is grounded in youths' digital worlds. It is old because technologists have been dreaming of an empowering, transformative integration of education and technology for over half a century.

*Making with Code* is a project of the Transformative Learning Technologies Lab (TLTL) in collaboration with the Independent Schools Foundation Academy. It is is a set of free, open-source computer science courses and related curriculum.
